# Excess rentals in London bike sharing

It's cool to hire bikes for cycling in London! Would you like to know how much bikes have been hired by month and year? Let’s take a look!

We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

## Bikes hired by month and year

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r Bikes hired per month,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=15}
bike15_20 <- bike %>% filter(year>=2015) %>% mutate(month0 = month(day))

ggplot(bike15_20, aes(x=bikes_hired))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_grid(rows=vars(year),cols=vars(month))+
  labs(title = "Distribution of bikes hired per month",
       x= 'Bike Rentals', y = "") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(20000, 40000, 60000), 
                labels = c('20K', '40K', '60K'))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
```


> Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

Yes! Bike Rentals in May and Jun in 2020 dropped significantly from previous years because of the lockdown caused by the covid-pandemic.


## Differences between Expected and actual level of bike rentals

Next, let’s calculate the expected number of rentals per month and per week between 2015-2019 by calculating the median number of rentals between 2015-2019. Then we can see how the actual rentals in each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Remember, `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`.


Our first plot looks at absolute changes from the expected level of monthly rentals.The blue line is the expected level of rentals, green areas are the positive excess rentals and pinks areas are the negative excess rentals.

```{r monthly_change, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=12}
bike15_19 <- bike %>% filter(year>=2015&year<=2019) %>% mutate(month0 = month(day))
#Calculate the monthly average between 2015-2019 using median 
expected_monthly_rentals <- bike15_19 %>% group_by(month0) %>% summarise(median_ex=median(bikes_hired))
#Calculate the acutual monthly average between 2015-2020 using median 
bike_month <- bike15_20 %>% group_by(year,month0) %>% summarise(median_ac=median(bikes_hired)) 
#left_join the dataframe
bike_month_excess <- left_join(bike_month,expected_monthly_rentals,by='month0')
bike_month_excess <- bike_month_excess %>% mutate (maxline=ifelse(median_ex>median_ac,median_ex,median_ac),
                                                   minline=ifelse(median_ex<median_ac,median_ex,median_ac))

# replicate the plot with two ribbons using different colors
ggplot(bike_month_excess,aes(x=month0))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=minline,ymax=median_ex),fill='lightpink')+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=median_ex,ymax=maxline),fill='lightgreen')+
  geom_line(aes(y=median_ex),color='blue',size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in Tfl Bike Rentals",
       subtitle="Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       x= '', y = "Bike Rentals",caption = "Source: Tfl, London Data Store") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12), 
                labels = c('JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR','APR','MAY','JUN','JUL','AUG','SEP','OCT','NOV','DEC'))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, margin = margin(0,15,0,0)))+
  NULL

```


The second plot looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. Again, green areas are the positive excess rentals by percentage and pinks areas are the negative excess rentals by percentage.The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r weekly_change, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=12}
#Calculate the weekly average between 2015-2019 using median 
expected_weekly_rentals <- bike15_19 %>% group_by(week) %>% summarise(median_ex=median(bikes_hired))
#Calculate the acutual weekly average between 2015-2020 using median 
bike_week <- bike15_20 %>% group_by(year,week) %>% summarise(median_ac=median(bikes_hired)) 
#left_join the dataframe
bike_week_excess <- left_join(bike_week,expected_weekly_rentals,by='week')
bike_week_excess <- bike_week_excess %>% mutate(bike_week_excess_rate = median_ac/median_ex-1)
bike_week_excess <- bike_week_excess %>% mutate (maxline=ifelse(bike_week_excess_rate>0,bike_week_excess_rate,0),
                                                   minline=ifelse(bike_week_excess_rate<0,bike_week_excess_rate,0),
                                                 whether_pos=ifelse(bike_week_excess_rate>0,'1','0'))
# replicate the plot with two ribbons and a rug using different colors
ggplot(bike_week_excess,aes(x=week))+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=0,xmax=13,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),fill="white", alpha=0.05)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=13,xmax=26,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),fill="grey", alpha=0.005)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=26,xmax=39,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),fill="white", alpha=0.05)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=39,xmax=53,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),fill="grey", alpha=0.005)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=minline,ymax=0),fill='lightpink')+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=maxline),fill='lightgreen')+
  geom_line(aes(y=bike_week_excess_rate),size=0.5) +
  geom_rug(aes(color=whether_pos),sides="b",show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightpink", "lightgreen"))+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  labs(title = "Weekly changes in Tfl Bike Rentals",
       subtitle="% change from weekly average \n calculated between 2015-2019",
       x= '', y = "week",caption = "Source: Tfl, London Data Store") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(13,26,39,53), 
                labels = c('13', '26', '39','53'))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(-0.6,-0.3,0,0.3,0.6), 
                labels = c('-60%', '-30%', '0%','30%','60%'))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, margin = margin(0,15,0,0)))+
