I was born in Ufa,big city *Russia*. It is located on the border between *European* and *Asian* part of Russia, near Ural Mountains.I moved to *Moscow* in 2016 to pursue my undergrad in **Economics** at **Higher School of Economics**. 

During undergrad I did a lot of extracurricular activities:
1. Being part of Student Club organise conferences, Hult International Business Game and entertainment events, whose audience was up to 500 people

2. Participating and being a captain of a team at 5 Business case-championships â€“ HEC Business Game, Oliver Wyman Impact and others. In a case competition, participants strive to develop the best solution to a business case study within an allocated time frame, typically with teams of two or more individuals pitted against each other. After these activities, I decided to try consulting  


3. Volunteer as Teaching assistance for Probability Theory, Micro and Macro Economics and Statistics

4. Did internships in consulting at McKinsey, Oliver Wyman and BCG. I had a project in different industries from transportation banking to the steel industry, and at various location both in Russia and abroad.

At LBS I am getting Master in Financial Analysis. My hobbies are snowboarding, theater, and traveling.
